    "### Relational Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common type of relational database you'll run into, is SQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What is SQL?\n",
    "* SQL stands for Structured Query Language\n",
    "* SQL lets you access and manipulate databases\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Can SQL do?\n",
    "* SQL can execute queries against a database\n",
    "* SQL can retrieve data from a database\n",
    "* SQL can insert records in a database\n",
    "* SQL can update records in a database\n",
    "* SQL can delete records from a database\n",
    "* SQL can create new databases\n",
    "* SQL can create new tables in a database\n",
    "* SQL can create stored procedures in a database\n",
    "* SQL can create views in a database\n",
    "* SQL can set permissions on tables, procedures, and views\n",
    "\n",
    "### Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "Databases look like something you've probably seen before.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a table called \"people\":\n",
    "\n",
    "| ID | Email                     | First Name | Last Name | Age |\n",
    "|----|---------------------------|------------|-----------|-----|\n",
    "| 1  | bilbobagginit@hotmial.com | Bilbo      | Baggins   | 48  |\n",
    "| 2  | 2face12@harvey.dent       | Harvey     | Dent      | 34  |\n",
    "| 3  | kim@Wexler.com            | Kim        | Wexler    | 36  |\n",
    "\n",
    "The important part is that they have a primary key (**ID** in this case) and sometimes have foreign keys, which help map to other tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SQL Statements\n",
    "Most of the actions you need to perform on a database are done with SQL statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following SQL statement selects all the records in the table \"people\" above:\n",
    "\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "SELECT * FROM people;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are lot more advanced SQL statements, but I'll save that for another course.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python-SQL Frameworks\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a bunch of Python-SQL frameworks:\n",
    "* psycopg - PostGreSQL \n",
    "* sqlite3\n",
    "* And More\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you learn one, you can learn any of the others. I have found the psycopg is hard to set up, but it's one of the best. Because of the hard set up, I'll start with sqlite3.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Workflow\n",
    "* Establish connection to Postgres database using psycopg2\n",
    "* Create a cursor\n",
    "* Use the cursor to execute SQL queries and retrieve data\n",
    "* Commit SQL actions\n",
    "* Close the cursor and connection"
